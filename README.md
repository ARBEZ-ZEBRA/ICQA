## ICQA-2K: Multi-Dimensional No-Reference Quality Assessment for Image Colorization

Automatic image colorization has achieved significant advancements, yet evaluating the quality of colorized images remains an ongoing challenge. Current research lacks dedicated datasets and evaluation models designed specifically for the unique artifacts and semantic demands of colorization. Conventional metrics fail to adequately address the ill-posed nature of the task, while existing no-reference quality measures often lack semantic awareness. To address this gap, we introduce ICQA-2K, a multi-dimensional benchmark along with a novel no-reference assessment framework. The ICQA-2K dataset comprises 2,000 samples synthesized via five representative colorizers, each annotated with Mean Opinion Scores across three dimensions: Chromatic Fidelity (CF), Semantic Color Consistency (SCC), and Perceptual Realism (PR). Building on this, we propose ICQA‑Net, a network that integrates chromatic analysis, semantic validation using category-specific color priors, and a global realism encoder. Experimental results show that ICQA‑Net achieves a SOTA SRCC of 0.9210, significantly outperforming existing metrics.
